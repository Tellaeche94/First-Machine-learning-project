# First-Machine-learning-project
These are the codes for my final project for Data Minning and Machine Learning 1

This project consisted in choosing 3 datasets, which didn’t have to be related, and applying appropriate machine learning techniques using R and the libraries we found suitable.

The datasets used and the machine learning implemented in each of them were:

	• Diamond Prices (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vittoriogiatti/diamondprices)

		o Multi-Linear Regression to predict the price of the diamond based in its characteristics.
    
		o K nearest neighbor (KNN) to predict the clarity of the diamond based in its characteristics
 
	• Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset)
 
		o Naïve Bayes to predict who suffered from diabetes based on their characteristics.
  
		o Decision Tree to predict who suffered from diabetes based on their characteristics.
  
		o Support Vector Machine to predict who suffered from diabetes based on their characteristics.
 
	• Real OR Fake Jobs (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/whenamancodes/real-or-fake-jobs)

		o Applied Naïve Bayes to predict if the advertised job was for a real job position or not.
